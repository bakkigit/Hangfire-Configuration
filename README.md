Hangfire Demo Application ðŸš€
This is a basic ASP.NET Core application demonstrating Hangfire, a powerful background job processing library. The project showcases how to use Hangfire for:

âœ… Fire-and-forget jobs (executed immediately)
âœ… Delayed jobs (scheduled to run after a set time)
âœ… Recurring jobs (executed at scheduled intervals)
âœ… Continuation jobs (executed after another job completes)

Technologies Used:
ASP.NET Core
Hangfire
SQL Server (for Hangfire storage)

Endpoints:
GET /FireAndForgetJob â†’ Runs a job instantly
GET /DelayedJob â†’ Runs a job after a 60-second delay

Why Use Hangfire?
Hangfire makes background job processing simple with minimal setup, supports persistence, and provides an intuitive dashboard for monitoring jobs.
